		<H2>My software collection</H2>
		In my Github page 
		<a href="https://github.com/calmsacibis995">(here)</a>
		, you can find a lot of cool stuff that I have worked on. Most of
		the stuff you find is source code from various operating systems,
		old and new, such as for Solaris, HP-UX, UNIX System V, Ultrix, etc.
		<BR>
		However, you can also spot some projects of mine, such as
		<I>Ayacc</I>
		, which is a modern version of the original Yacc for modern systems.
		You can read more about it in its
		<a href="ayacc/index.html">web page</a>
		.
