        <h2>AYACC</h2>
        <i>Ayacc</i>
        is a modern version of the original Yacc developed at Bell Labs. I tried my best to eliminate
        warning messages, but there are still some messages remaining. I'm trying my best to clean up
        and optimize the code, but there are a lot of things that need to be done. One of these things
        is to make it work under macOS and maybe under Windows using Cygwin. (WSL should also work,
        but I haven't tested).

        <b>NOTE:</b>

        <I>Ayacc</I>
        is based on the V7/32v Yacc, from 1979, but updated (for the most part) for modern systems.
